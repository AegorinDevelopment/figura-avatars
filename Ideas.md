## Allow different skins to select
- Adding a skins folder to place multiple skin files
- Loading all skins on init, creating indices and commands
- Ping skin changes every few seconds

- Change on pose
- Allow toggle with hotkey

## Avatar size reduction
- Load host scripts only for host

## Custom UI elements
- Expanding the ui with custom elements to add macros and inputs
- All local scripts to keep the avatar size small

### Lib for dynamic text input as ui overlay
- Input text in a defined text field, that does not trigger other options

### Automatic input translation
- Input that automatically translates text

### Custom macros
